Create a network policy to allow traffic from the Internal application only to the payroll-service and db-service.
Use the spec given below. You might want to enable ingress traffic to the pod to test your rules in the UI.
Also, ensure that you allow egress traffic to DNS ports TCP and UDP (port 53) to enable DNS resolution from the internal pod.
# Policy Name: internal-policy
# Policy Type: Egress
# Egress Allow: payroll
# Payroll Port: 8080
# Egress Allow: mysql
# MySQL Port: 3306
